<h1>my favorite anime character</h1>
<p>sorry but i cant choose one of them, because they all are legends,
like madara, obito, jiraiya, kakashi, luffy, zoro, rayleigh, ace,gol D roger and many of them,
i didn't said that i like only them, there are so many legends in different animes, but i cant say so many of them bc it wont be homework anymore
i will choose naruto bc he had saddest childhood.</p>
<p>lets start with naruto. naruto had so bad childhood, bc he had 9 tail beast (kurama) and he was orphan, bc 9 tail beast killed his kushina (mother) and minato (father),
they died, bc they were printing 9 tail beast in their child, and9 tail beast knew about that and he wanted to stop it, so he was going to kill naruto with his nail, when it was about to hit naruto kushina and minato stoppet is with their body,
thats how they died, from them naruto was abandoned, then 1 day he meet old guy who was third hokage, and from then  naruto had a dream to become strongest hokage, he was doing everything to become strongest hokage,and his super power is never giving up.</p>
<p>thats why naruto is legend it teaches us about life naruto tells us if you wont give up you will make it. madara tells, in this accursed world only pain, suffering and fulitly exist.both of them are legends for only this words. thats why it is to hard to choose favorite character.
every character have dreams and history so you cant choose favorite bc that</p>
